# FIFA-World-CUP-Analysis
TODO - So in this project I will try to analyse the datasets of FIFA Worldcup, wherein I will try to find which country hosted most of the matches, which city hostes maximum matches, which country won the maximum matches and the worldcup, etc. I will be using Pandas library for manipulation of data and matplotlib and seaborn libraries for visualization of the dataset.

# Project Title - FIFA World Cup Analysis

* This repository presents FIFA World Cup data analysis.
* With the help of this project we can see some useful insights and make decisions. 

# Description 
The Motive of this project is to analyze FIFA World Cup Data,we have the data from 1930 to 2014. The data we have is separated by Matches ,Players and Cup Holders since 1930 to 2014. Lot of Analysis has been done with nice Visualizations to understand and to get insights from data.

# PROJECT GOAL
This project is based on FIFA World Cup Analysis to get insights about the Matches, patterns about players, Patterns about cup holders, Home Groud Advantage and many more things**
The data here i used is taken from kaggle and the data is from since 1930 to 2014, with 3 excel files separated by players ,matches and cup holders 

# Project Motivation
I belongs to a sports background (Professional Badminton Player) and  I like Football vaery much, often i used to play and i will see the live telecasted football matches without missing them, so to practice PYTHON and Data Analysis, i have choosen this FIFA World Cup Dataset

# Lessons Learned

 I learned a lot of new things, some of them are given below ---
 * Firstly, I feel more comfortable about NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn after completion of this project, then i learned these document preparation which is provided by iNeuron.
 * How to make Low Level Design (LLD) Document?
 * How to make High Level Design (HLD) Document?
 * How to make Architecture Document Design?
 * How to make Wireframe Document Design?
 * How to make Detail Project Report (DPR)?
 * How to make Project Demo Video?
